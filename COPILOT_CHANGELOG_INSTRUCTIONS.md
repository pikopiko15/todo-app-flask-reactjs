# Instructions for Keeping a Copilot Change Log

1. **Create a Changelog File**
   - Add a file named `COPILOT_CHANGELOG.md` in your project root.

2. **Log Every Copilot Change**
   - After each Copilot-assisted change, add an entry to `COPILOT_CHANGELOG.md` with:
     - **Date**
     - **File(s) changed**
     - **Brief description of the change**
     - **Reason for the change (optional)**
     - **Your initials**

3. **Entry Format Example**
   ```
   ## [YYYY-MM-DD]
   - **File:** src/app.py
   - **Change:** Refactored function `get_tasks` for better readability.
   - **Reason:** Suggested by Copilot for improved maintainability.
   - **By:** KM
   ```

4. **Commit the Changelog**
   - Always commit `COPILOT_CHANGELOG.md` along with your code changes.

5. **Review Regularly**
   - Periodically review the changelog to track Copilotâ€™s impact and for future reference.
